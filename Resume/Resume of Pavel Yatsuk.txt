Employment history:

07/2007 – present time : Senior SDE, Bing, Microsoft corp.
    Cosmos team is building distributed storage and execution environment for Bing.
    
    I was supporting and improving RSL library, Paxos protocol implementation that is 
    used in multiple services across Bing. I implemented multiple reliability and 
    performance improvements that allowed higher utilization of cluster resources.
    
    I worked in execution team where I implemented scalability improvements that 
    allowed to significantly increase volume of data processed by single job. I also 
    implemented throttling solution that reduced wasted cluster resources by 
    avoiding network congestions while maintaining high system utilization.
    
    I worked in a team of 3 people where we designed and implemented centralized 
    process scheduler for big cluster. This scheduler is capable of making tens of 
    thousands of scheduling decisions per second while ensuring customer resource 
    allocation fairness and optimizing for data locality. We filed patent application 
    on results of this work.
    
    I worked on storage stack components where I improved scalability of 
    cross-cluster data replication.
    
    I received 2 Gold Star awards while working in this group.
    
    Skills: distributed systems design/algorithms, C++, C#, high performance network 
    applications

09/2005 – 07/2007 : SDE, Forefront client security, Microsoft corp.
    Forefront client security provides antivirus/antimalware protection for PC 
    workstations that can be controlled over the network. 
    
    I worked in a team that was developing Vulnerability Assessment component, it 
    collects information about computer's configuration from different sources and 
    evaluates computer's vulnerability level. 
    
    While working on this team I designed and developed number of features including 
    ScanJob, and manifest updates. I optimized component’s memory usage and 
    performance.  I worked with outsourcing team on implementing object processors and 
    checks definitions.
    
    Skills: C++, C#, scripting, COM, XML, WUA API, WMI.

05/2001 – 09/2005 : SDET, DataWorks team (MDAC) , Microsoft corp.
    MDAC is client stack APIs that provides access to Microsoft SQL server.

    I was testing network protocol formats and different network protocols used by 
    MDAC, protocol encryption. I designed and developed man-in-the-middle testing 
    framework which allows to implement test scenarios that involve manipulation of 
    the network data that is sent between server and client, network failure 
    injection. 

    Skills: C++, C#, scripting (primarily JScript), developing high performance 
    network applications, COM, SQL, database access APIs 
    (ODBC/OLEDB/ ADO).

02/2000 - 05/2001 : Software development engineer/lead, WebSci Technologies, 
Novosibirsk, Russia
    WebSci  Technologies was developing suite for designing and deploying dynamic 
    database backed web applications.

    I worked on layout engine, HTML/WML generation engine in runtime server and Java 
    based designer client.

    Skills: C++ for Windows/Linux/Unix, XML (XSLT), HTML (Dynamic HTML, CSS), 
    JavaScript, Java. 

07/1997 - 02/2000 : Various positions, Novosibirsk, Russia

=====================================================================================
Hobby projects:
Magnet board: Windows phone 7 application with Google App Engine backend
    The goal of the project was to develop scalable client server application with 
    close to real time updates. Also the goal was to learn Google App Engine platform 
    and smartphone networking capabilities.

Flipbook : Windows Phone 7 application
    http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=6fd17f47-f425-e011-854c-00237de2db9e
    Finger painting animation application. The goal of project was to learn WP7 
    platform, GPU programming.

Paxos implementation
    The goal of the project was to understand paxos protocol better and to experiment 
    with different variants of protocol. Application included emulation of 
    faulty/slow network with faulty/slow nodes. 

LiveJournal crawler
    The goal of the project was to experiment with algorithms on large directed 
    graphs. As part of this project I’ve implemented paged file storage with cache 
    layer, atomic operations model, BTree/queue/stack collections on top of it, 
    map/set on top of BTree, graph on top of map.
